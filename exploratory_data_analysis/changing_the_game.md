*This exploratory analysis of America's favorite past-time takes an in-depth look at how the Negro Leagues altered the style of play in Baseball through statistics alone.*

#### Our Data

The data we are using is pulled from baseballreference. This site gets its data from seamheads which utilizes newspapers, articles, and other first-hand accounts of baseball statistics to gather stats. The data we will be using in our project takes a look at 1929 and 1937 negro and MLB league teams. Our primary objective is to highlight how much more aggressive the negro league teams were in their play style compared to MLB teams. To do this, we will be pulling certain statistics (such as (stolen bases and sacrifice hits) to average out and plot in an attempt to visualize our conclusions.
