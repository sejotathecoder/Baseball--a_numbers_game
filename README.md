# Baseball--a_numbers_game
*A data science driven inquiry into understanding, contextualizing, and appreciating the Negro Leagues.*

__Why are you interested in this field/domain?__

We both come from a background with an appreciation for the game of baseball, and in particular, the Negro Leagues. Stories like Satchel Paige telling his outfielders to sit down as he would strike batters out or Josh Gibson's fabled home run in Pittsburgh that never came down help to illuminate the legend and superhuman talents of the leagues, but spotty statistical records have long kept the leagues just legend for many who weren't fortunate enough to see them in real life. 

Following decades of research and lobbying by organizations like the Seamheads Negro League Database, in December 2020 Major League Baseball officially designated six Negro Leagues from 1920 to 1948 as having "Major League" status, elevating them to the same status as the American and National Leagues of the same time period. Most importantly from a data science perspective, this also meant that going forward Negro League statistics and records from the time period would be included with MLB statistics and not relegated to their own category. Following this decision, in June 2021 leading online baseball almanac Baseball Reference updated its database to include Negro League statistics, making them more accessible and more comparable to non-Negro League statistics.

Negro Leagues Baseball Museum co-founder Larry Lester told the New York Times that “The beauty of these stats is that they now humanize these folk heroes, and they’re no longer mythical figures like Paul Bunyan or the steel-driving John Henry. These stats legitimize their accomplishments.” Following this line of thinking, with this project, we would like to use these statistics to further humanize and appreciate the greatness of these players.

__What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?__
1. How did different ballparks during the Negro Leagues affect their stats? And if a level-playing field was mandated for all Negro League parks, would that change how we view some players today? 
2. Negro Leaguers were subject to substantially lower field and equipment quality than white MLB players of their time, even when they were playing in the same ballparks. How did this affect their stats and can we compare the two leagues? 
3. In regards to the previous question, can we determine the state/quality of the Negro League fields based on the percentage of errors and other statistics that represent field malfunctions?

__Finding Data__

We are lucky enough to live in a time when there is lots of publicly available data made possible by governments, journalists, academics, and companies. In this section, you will identify and download at least 3 sources of data related to your domain of interest described above (into a folder you create called data/). You won't be required to use all of these sources, but it will give you practice discovering data. If your data is made available through a Web API, you don't need to download it. For each source of data, provide the following information:

 - Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?
 - How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?
 - How many observations (rows) are in your data?
 - How many features (columns) are in the data?
 - What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
