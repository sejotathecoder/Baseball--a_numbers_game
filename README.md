*Comparing early 20th century baseball statistics to the modern day. Focusing on a juxtaposition between the negro leagues and today's players.*

__Why are you interested in this field/domain?__
  - We both come from a background with an appreciation for the game of baseball. Our intent is to shine a light on the negro leagues and how talented these players were during their time. Skilled enough to compete with modern day superstars, and we hope to display statistics and data to show that.

__What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?__
1. How did different ballparks during the Negro Leagues effect their stats? And if a level-playing field was mandated for all Negro League parks, wwould that change how we view some players today? 
2. Negro Leaguers were subject to substantially lower field and equipent quality than white MLB players of their time. How did this effect their stats and can we compare the two leagues? 
3. In regards to the previous question, can we determine the state/quality of the Negro League fields based on the percentage of errors and other statistics that represent field malfunctions?
